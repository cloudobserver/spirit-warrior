# Love & Power /// Here & Now

## The scary and fearless path of a spiritual warrior

This is a guide to freedom. It is for those who are fully committed to becoming free, and letting go of everything, including ego, possessions, and body. Those who are partially committed to freedom are also invited but may find this path threatening. It is threatening. If you have no experience with higher consciousness, this is not going to make sense.

### We exist in multiple dimensions

We are multi-dimensional beings. We live in physical bodies in a physical world. At the same time, we are one with the infinite. These realities are both valid but they contradict each other. It’s the weirdest thing. When seeking the meaning of life, we encounter irreconcilable contradictions.

So we live in two worlds at once. In the physical world, the soul is incarnated in a body and is completely identified with the body. The soul consists of God consciousness and somehow this consciousness is confined to a body. On this earth, the soul is focused on staying alive and accomplishing various things. The soul experiences an endless series of problems, activities, and thoughts. Important stuff. People may die.

Simultaneously the soul is pure consciousness that is perfect and complete. You can experience this in meditation. There is pure blissful awareness inside you that is beyond this world, in which you know there are no problems anywhere. Everything is perfect as it is.

How can these conflicting realities both be true?

| Physical World | Spirit World |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Temporary | Eternal |
| Logical | Unexplainable |
| Good/bad | All good |
| Unsatisfying | Blissful |
| At risk | Invincible |
| Separation | Oneness |
| Limitations/scarcity | Complete security |
| Action & Doing | Pure witness & Not doing |
| There are many | There is only one |
| Hatred has power | Love is the only power |
| Narrow consciousness | All-knowing consciousness |
| Problems everywhere | Perfection that includes all imperfection |

There is a fundamental problem with translating wisdom from the invincible dimension to the material dimension. The wisdom is true but it doesn’t solve the problems of the material dimension. Native cultures and ancient cultures have ways and tools for dealing with these contradictions. These can be helpful to a point. But there is no substitute for direct investigation on your own. I present the following thoughts and opinions for your consideration. Please sort out and discard the ones that don't work for you. And the ones you like, keep 'em.

Through all experiences, you are held safely and protected by infinite love; there never was a time when this was not so. And this will always be so as as you travel through this world and the hallways of eternity.

### Love is all that matters

Your job is to manifest love at all times. Everything else is secondary to that.

When you came into this world, you were naturally filled with loving awareness. But when immersed in physical existence, there is a tendency to forget the central importance of love. My intention is to help you rediscover the love within you.
The word "love" doesn't come close to conveying the fullness of divine intelligence. In fact, these principles cannot be adequately conveyed in words. But it doesn't hurt to try.

### Your mission - Recover the missing light

There is a light in this world that is more powerful than any darkness. This supreme light has come to earth as you. And also as all beings and all forms. This light is invincible and indestructible. With practice, you can access this inner light.
Like a hero from an ancient myth, you're on a mission to find this treasure. You must defeat the enemies so that the kingdom can be saved. But it's really about you confronting yourself. And it's custom-made for you to fail in dealing with it. And the more you run from it, the more you run into it.

### Are you in control of your thoughts?

The world is rich with diverse cultures. Every culture has shared beliefs and understandings that allow the society to function and survive. Every culture imposes beliefs and expects certain behaviors. But beliefs are human inventions. They give a structure to reality. But reality is more complex and nuanced than the structure. The beliefs solve problems while also creating other problems.

Any culture seems valid and true from the inside, but may look a little crazy from another cultural perspective. There is no set of beliefs that is the final and correct version of reality. There is no unbiased authority to evaluate cultural systems, because every person is a product of a particular culture, and is therefore biased. So it is up to the individual to sort out truth from untruth.

Cultural norms are passed on from generation to generation. The child absorbs information like a sponge and imitates whoever is around, mostly family members. Gradually the child learns all the social and cultural conventions. Over decades, the child becomes dominated by social pressures that dictate behavior. The original joy and spontaneity of childhood gets lost along the way. The child, now grown up, thinks and lives according to external authorities, fighting battles that were set up by someone else.
Is that you? Are you trapped by cultural rules and the expectations of family and friends?

Assume for a moment that there is an ideal society that has the best possible beliefs. Sounds good. However those who grow up in such a society are still following behavior dictated by an outside authority. A prison made of gold is still a prison.
There is no substitute for direct experience. Seek out the truth for yourself. It is not enough for someone to tell you what is important and what to do. This life is not supposed to be a guided tour. Don't accept any belief unless you find it to be true in your experience.

### Change thought patterns and beliefs

Observe your thoughts and behavior.  Look for beliefs habitual thoughts. Do you behave predictably, following habits and social conventions?

For every belief, ask yourself, "Does this belief serve me? Does it make me feel joyous?"

Especially look for beliefs about personal identity. Don't become identified with your part in the drama. Whatever roles you play in this life are temporary. If you cling to them, you will suffer. What aspects of your life are you most proud of and attached to? What things are part of your identity? Your self concept, your idea of who you are, your ego identity is a trap. Remember the other dimensions of yourself - a wondrous being of light, united with the universal mind.

Don't identify with your body. The body is graceful and stunning in the vigor of youth, and yet it is destined to break down and die. It is like a set of clothes that will be discarded after some time. Don't cling to it.

If a belief doesn't serve you, change it. Break out. Do things that change yourself image, that break up your identity. Be creative. Be adventurous. If you're always loud, try being silent, or vice versa.

Steer your mind away from negative story lines. Focus on higher thoughts. Try to fill your mind only with divine thoughts. Through sustained effort, you can reduce negative beliefs and thoughts. Make a game of it: Put a star for each day you avoid negative influences, such as addictions to media or anything.

Avoid negative influences, such as less-uplifting environments and people. If you need a role model for joyous living, observe children; they are the best for that. Their words and actions are always real and refreshing.

### Be aware of bio-programming

Biological programming consists of deeply-engrained thought patterns and emotions that drive human survival and reproduction. These are interwoven with cultural programming but are even deeper.
Take for example sexual attraction. We have a strong tendency to evaluate members of the opposite sex. These judgemental thoughts prevent one from seeing the beauty and wonder of each individual.
Recognize when lust and other biological impulses are driving your thoughts and actions. Challenge these thoughts. If you decide to keep them, fine. Let it be your conscious choice. And observe if this choice brings happiness.

### Live in the moment

Don't get stuck thinking about the past and future. Many times that's what people want to talk about. It's not helpful. Sure, we need to plan for the future but stay in the moment. When you're buying a plane ticket, be in the moment. The purpose of this moment is not to get to some other moment when things will be better. Don't wait! Experience this moment fully.
If you need an example, look to the world's foremost authorities on joyous living - children.

### Listen for inner guidance

There are nonphysical beings who can help you access divine intelligence. Maybe these beings are part of your higher self. Some may say these forces are all in your mind,  "imaginary". It's totally mysterious. You can think of these beings as existing in other dimensions. They may take the form of archangels, animal spirits, ascended masters such as Christ, whatever.
When you face a decision, ask for help from these inner sources, whatever they may be.

To receive inner guidance, begin with small decisions, like what to do during some free time. Ask about a certain option and listen inside for some slight emotion, dread or joy or whatever it is. Usually I get a feeling about the option or choice. If the response is just silence, no answer, then probably either choice will turn out about the same. There are no important consequences. If I don't get a feeling, I continue to let the question remain sort of in the air. I decide not to decide. And then later, some guidance may emerge. You may think of it as listening for God's will about a situation.

After awhile you will gain confidence in your inner guidance. This technique will also increase your overall ability to detect vibrations in a wide range of situations.

### Discover catalysts for spiritual power

Based on your likes and inclinations, find ways to awaken spiritual power and child-like joy. Meditation is perhaps the most well known way to access spiritual power. That is a vast topic of it's own.
Examples -
Maybe you love gospel singing such as InterFaith gospel choir
Maybe you go alone to sacred sites and dance all night.
Maybe you gain strength by reciting verses from the Bible while listening to classic rock.
Maybe you like giving coffee and cookies to the homeless people.
Maybe you find power while meditating in a cave or while standing on a rocky beach on a stormy night. Or a church, or other power spot that calls to you.
Invent your own methods. There are no rules.
When you search for Truth, Truth itself will assist you.

Notice when your will power and motivation are strong and use those moments to best advantage.

The best catalyst for spiritual power is to spend time with a God-realized person. The radiant presence of such a being will transform you, and will connect you directly to God.

### Let go of anger

Engaging in verbal violence is equally as harmful as physical violence. Do not respond to anger with anger. Don't get into the cycle of destructive words and behavior. When you lash out with angry words or violence, you damage the mental atmosphere of yourself and the world. Anger and violence are like a sword that is sharp on both ends. It damages both the attacked and the attacker. It creates misery and distorts your perception. It's not effective for dealing with difficult people. It has no benefits.

Make a resolution to avoid expressing anger. When negative emotions start to overpower you, don't go there. Let go as quickly as possible. Immediately relax and generate loving thoughts. When someone is angry, think of them as a child of God who is doing the best they can. Regardless of the situation, know that it's possible to maintain your love and self-esteem.

### Multi-processing

In emotionally-charged conversations in a work environment, there are often two important components of the interaction:
•	Factual content, the issue we are dealing with, such as, "Your report was late."
•	Emotional content, often implied, such as, "Your report was late because you are spaced out."
Both of these are problems that need to be addressed, not just one, both. The fact that the report was late is something to talk about and fix. But that conversation will be more effective if there is an atmosphere of mutual love and respect. So the emotional content tends to be a bigger problem in the long term. Sometimes there is not time to address the emotional content until later. Even so, it's most important is to reconcile the feelings and concerns of everyone. Sooner is better.
Here's an example of how you might might begin this conversation, "Maybe we should talk about the issues that cause this problem so that we can do better. Maybe later today?"

When talking about the problem, hopefully in a relaxed environment, just tell the truth. Try to learn from the situation. What can you do differently to be the best person you can be? Don't try to defend yourself or win the argument. Try to avoid blaming someone or making them wrong. Focus on the indisputable facts. Also you can say "When [specific thing] happened, I felt [some emotion]." But without blaming them, it's just a fact, I had a feeling and a reaction. It's all about honest dialogue in an atmosphere of acceptance. A kind and loving attitude is crucial.

Do your best to maintain a positive relationship with everyone involved. Never buy into anyone's attempt to put you down. You are God's innocent child.

### Defend against emotional manipulation

Human beings are skillful in manipulating emotions and behavior of others. It happens a lot. Often an emotional charge is conveyed indirectly through words that are not overtly harmful or manipulative. Usually such attacks originate subconsciously, meaning the attacker is not aware of being manipulative.

These stealth attacks may seem insignificant and harmless. They work in the background to drain your energy and distract you from your natural state: happiness. The only signal may be a slight feeling of irritation. Or a visceral feeling, or a twinge of emotion, triggered by a seemingly normal comment.
If your mind is already full of negative emotions, the additional irritation may go unnoticed. So that's why a pure and quiet mind is a good defense. It's more sensitive to negative vibrations.

When you detect uncomfortable feelings, don't ignore it. It's very easy to make a negative comment or gesture. Then the person may say, "What's your problem?" And bam! they score an emotional hit. This is the skillful emotional manipulation that you don't want. You want to be happy. All you can do is quickly go to your highest thoughts. Remember you are God's innocent child.

This is also a chance to see how well you can control your mind. The person is subconsciously trying to cause emotional damage. Don't let them win. Contain your negative emotions. You may have to direct your thoughts very specifically in a positive direction. For example, think of a child who loves you.
Sometimes you may let a mean remark slip out, leading to a painful conversation. It happens. Don't worry. You will get stronger with practice. Eventually you will come to relish these challenges.

### Defend against shadow forces

Some negative thoughts and impulses may come from covert "shadow" forces that oppose spiritual development. This may sound paranoid, but as you gain inner strength and purity, you may encounter obstructions that seem deliberate.
It seems there are forces in this world that want us to suffer. Some say negative tendencies in the human psyche have developed into parasitic shadows that sabotage those on the spiritual path. I admit this sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory. Like all the claims in this document, it's a good idea to find out if it's true for you.

When you feel that negative thoughts have come out of nowhere, defend yourself. Confront the thoughts, "What are you doing here? Who let you in? Go away! I don't need you depleting my energy."
You can gain protection against these forces by connecting with beings of light. For example, you can gain protection from nature spirits through "shamanic journeying".

### Let go of self-importance, and be humble

The world doesn't exist to conform to your preferences. Don't be annoyed or offended by things. Don't try to bend the truth to defend yourself. Don't try to win or be right. Be a witness to what is happening without judgment.

To become more humble, remember your defects and previous mistakes. And consider the mistakes you will make in the future.
Humility means accepting your role on this earth. Whether that role is exalted or hidden, doesn't matter. Humility is related to self-esteem. You need both. Know that you are a good person, not better than anyone.

If you are tempted to judge someone, look instead for their good qualities. Try to help the person to be happy and successful, seeking nothing in return.

### Be impeccable with your speech

Spoken words are a form of manifestation and wield immense power. Whatever words you speak contribute to harmony or disharmony in the world. It's an important part of how we create our reality.
Always tell the truth and be kind. If the truth is unkind then remain silent. Your speech should always show respect for every person or being, no matter what. It may help to remember that in the higher dimensions, we are all connected, so everyone is part of you. Thinking in this way makes it easier to be humble and have respect.
Don't express anger. It's always harmful, both to the giver and receiver.
Less obvious is the harmful effect of gossip. It's like a toxic spill in the group mind. As much as possible, avoid speaking about others who are not present.
Keeping silent for a day can help you understand the power of speech, both the benefits and the detriments.

### Remain mysterious and unknown

As a spiritual seeker, you should strive to remove your ego, your idea of who you are. (Explain why that's important). Notice what happens when you explain yourself to others. The usual result is to strengthen your ego.
Another effect is hard to explain but you can feel it. Whatever you tell people, they think about it. Then their thoughts will pin you down somehow. It's better to remain unknown so people cannot pin you down, so you are not encumbered by their thoughts.

Just tell people the minimum about yourself, preferably nothing. Don't brag or complain. Maintain a distance. Remain mysterious. Create a fog around yourself.

Of course you will have opportunities to really help someone by telling personal experiences. But don't over do it. Ask yourself, "I am I bragging or complaining? Am I building up my ego? Is this helpful?"

### Reject labels and limitations

Don't buy into story lines about who you are. Don't give importance to attacks against you. Someone may vaguely imply that you are incompetent or unattractive. Just remember who you are, and where you come from. "I am an innocent child of the universe." When someone makes up a story about you, it is about them, their cultural biases and ego games. It is not about you. You are not responsible for their reality.

Remain alert for comments that limit or define you. Or someone may assign a label to you, which might even be a flattering label. Through humility, you will recognize that a flattering label is just a label.

Whatever someone may say about you, the opposite is also part of who you are. All good and bad qualities, from altruism to cruelty, are present in you and every person. Every human potential is in you, which means you are not better or worse than anyone else. This leads to humility and self-esteem, and to respect for all.

### We're all connected

What belongs to you and what belongs to me cannot be neatly divided. We all breathe the same air. No one can say, "This air is mine, and the other air is yours." Like this, our destinies are connected and interrelated. When seen in this light, it's hard to defend the idea of private property.
Furthermore our thoughts are interconnected and contribute to the mental atmosphere of the planet. Your thoughts effect the status of the world, for better or worse. You are not an isolated agent.

### It's all temporary

Everything in this world belongs to God only, and there is nothing here that we can truly call our own. We come with nothing and we leave with nothing. This life will be over in a short time.

What are doing here? Are we supposed to learn something here?

At any moment, you may cross the threshold of death and plunge into a new journey. Although this journey ends and another begins, although doors open and close, you are not really going anywhere. Death is not the end.

### Momentary pleasures are not satisfying

On the surface, it appears that selfish actions and material objects bring happiness. However, if you are observant and honest, you will soon realize that momentary pleasures are not all that satisfying. They provide, at best, a mixture of joy and sorrow. It takes some life experiences to realize it doesn't really work. I mean, they're okay but haven't you got something better?

### Do good actions

When the opportunity arises to do some good action, be the first to jump in and do it. Perform as many good actions as possible. Leave the world in better condition than you found it. Accept with joy and enthusiasm the work that comes to you.
Whatever actions you perform, always give your best. Sometimes you need to move fast but don't get tense. Enjoy the fast pace.
This action in this moment may be your last act, your last stand on earth. Give your best so that you have no regrets regardless of the outcome. You may not be able to win every battle, but you can always do your best.

### Reduce selfishness and serve the poor

Give excess wealth to the poor. But don't create a new ego identity as a noble person who serves the poor. Don't tell anyone. Let it be a secret between you and God.
Have faith that the universe is taking care of you. Consider how much money and resources you really need. When self-centered desires arise, let them go as much as possible. At least aspire to be less selfish sometime in the future.
Anyway the search for personal security isn't going to work in the long run. The body can't be made secure. Ask yourself, "Is saving money for my imaginary future more important than helping people who are suffering now?" Purge yourself of unnecessary things. Consider getting rid of possessions that you are most attached to. Nobody said that freedom is easy.

### Accept everything with gratitude

It is the nature of life to have many problems. So relax. Don't worry. Confront your problems while remaining peaceful inside.

When difficulties come, remind yourself, "God gave me this experience, and so it must be bringing me closer to God. Now I am fulfilling some difficult karma. So that's good. That much more is paid off!"
Always be enthusiastic and optimistic, even when facing death.

### Sorrow is the ultimate catalyst

Everyone encounters difficult experiences, unacceptable events that appear to be complete disasters. From the physical perspective, there is no way to deal with such experiences. When the worst possible thing happens, you are helpless. You can only call out to some greater power, somewhere. Normal ego thought processes are futile. In this way, sorrow is the catalyst that brings you closer to God.

In the words of Neem Karoli, "I love sorrow. It brings me closer to God."
Amma encourages spiritual seekers, "Cry out to your God. Call out from the bottom of your heart with all your might, What use is this life? Why did you leave me here? How can I live without you? Where are you? Come before me right now! What use is this life without knowing you?"
When you call out in complete sorrow, it awakens the divine. The entire universe bows down to this depth of prayer. It awakens the redemptive power of God's love, the light more powerful than any darkness, the peace beyond understanding.

### Love yourself

Love and accept yourself as you are now. Like everyone, you have some mental and physical defects. Be optimistic that you can overcome your inner problems. Be thankful for whatever contribution you can make. Whatever work is in front of you, be thankful. Be a strong and useful presence in the world. Invest in yourself, your skills and abilities. Have self-confidence.

### Walk in balance on the earth

Honor the earth with prayers, ceremonies, and gratitude. Live sustainably as much as possible. Although we live in an age of environmental destruction, don't allow yourself to feel depressed or negative. The earth reflects back your thoughts, so focus on positive and loving thoughts. Believe in the power of truth and the human spirit.

Develop sustainable skills for producing food and other necessities. Increase the production of goods and services in your community. Keep the means of production in alignment with your values. Find your own way to give to the community.

We need both love and science. Science gives us enormous power. But love is more important because without love we will misuse power.

We need political action to protect the earth, especially large-scale civil disobedience. Stand up for what is right and God will give you courage. Join forces with those who are building a better world for our children.

Accept the present situation however pleasant or difficult, with a can-do attitude. Move forward with love and enthusiasm. Your actions may not turn out as intended. It may have the opposite effect. That's not in our control. But we do have control over our intentions: we can try our best to serve the world. Anyone is capable of making a positive contribution, even a smile is enough.

### Identify core challenges

What are the crucial challenges you face? What issues make you unhappy, tense, upset, or worried? Identify them specifically. How can you confront these challenges head-on?

Believe in your ability to meet these challenges. How would you proceed toward your goals if you knew you could not fail?

### Divine grace

Any task requires two factors to succeed: grace and personal effort. Only through grace can anyone escape the illusions and social traps of human existence. There is no path to God's grace. It comes for no reason, it cannot be earned. You can only love the Supreme with all your heart. That in itself is grace.

To know and experience divine grace, with it's unearthly love and intimacy, is perhaps the most sublime of human experiences.

### What is a spiritual warrior?

A spiritual warrior is one who declares all-out war on the thought patterns in his or her own mind that block the joy of human experience. The spiritual warrior is comfortable with physical reality and is also familiar with higher consciousness and non-physical reality. The spiritual warrior is able to live in two worlds at once, knowing that only love exists and everything is perfect as is.
And that everything is screwed up and broken.
And is okay with that.
And is not okay with that.

The spiritual warrior knows unshakeable peace. That "myself" doesn't exist and "others" also don't exist. There is nothing to seek and nothing to find. There is no enemy to fight against and defeat. There is only the nectarous love beyond understanding

Meanwhile in the physical world, the warrior fights with all strength and determination to confront the adversaries and battles of this world, most especially self-imposed limitations.

Beyond that, there are no rules or formulas for a spiritual warrior. You can be a spiritual warrior in any situation, in any kind of work, anywhere.

### My challenges

Be more generous.
Release tension and relax.
Respond compassionately to everyone in the moment.
Let go of anger, irritation, and judgment.
Let go of (or otherwise deal with) lust.
